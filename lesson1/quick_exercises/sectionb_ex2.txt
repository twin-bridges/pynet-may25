a. By convention, how would you represent a variable "my address" in Python?

Answer: my_address

Python variable names are (by convention) all lower case and use underscore as the word
separator.


b. By convention, how would you represent "my address" if you wanted to make it be a 
   constant?

Answer: MY_ADDRESS

Python constants are ALL UPPERCASE and use underscore for the word separator. Once again, 
this is by convention (and not enforced by the language).

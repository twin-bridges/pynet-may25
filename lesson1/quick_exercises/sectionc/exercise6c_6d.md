### c. In the REPL use string concatenation to combine two strings.

```python
# In Python REPL
>>> my_str = "Hello " + "World"
>>> print(my_str)
Hello World
```

### d. In the REPL, create a variable named `data` which contains `"some text"`, use the `+=` operator on the `data` variable to add `" more text"` to the `data` variable. Inspect the `data` variable after doing this.

```python
# In IPython REPL
In [1]: data = "some text"

In [2]: data += " more text"

In [3]: data
Out[3]: 'some text more text'

In [4]: print(data)
some text more text
```

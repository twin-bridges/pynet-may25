### Using the REPL, create a list named 'cities' that some number of city names.

### a. Find the length of this list.

```python
In [1]: cities = ["San Francisco", "Dallas", "London", "Tokyo", "Berlin", "Sydney"]

In [2]: len(cities)
Out[2]: 6
```

### b. Test "city_name" in "cities" for both a city that exists in the list and for one that doesn't.

```python
# List membership check
In [3]: "Sydney" in cities
Out[3]: True

In [4]: "Rome" in cities
Out[4]: False
```

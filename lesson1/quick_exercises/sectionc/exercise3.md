### a. In the REPL create the following:Â  name = "Jerome Morrow".

```python
In [16]: name = "Jerome Morrow"
```


### b. Chain the .upper() and split() methods together. In other words, in a single expression call both methods one after the other.

```python
In [19]: name = "Jerome Morrow"

In [20]: name.upper().split()
Out[20]: ['JEROME', 'MORROW']
```
